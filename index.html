            <p>
              The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized chatbot systems, resulting in unprecedented levels of intelligence as seen in OpenAI's ChatGPT. This success of ChatGPT on language tasks has inspired the community to anticipate a similar success paradigm in the multimodal space, where both language and vision (LV) modalities are involved in the human-machine interaction to unlock many new scenarios, leading to the increasingly popular research topic of building general-purpose assisants. GPT-4V is such an example, taking one step forward to showcase the interesting capabitlies of chatbots with langauge-image input and langauge output.
              However, despite its impressive performance, GPT-4V is limited in: (1) it is largely a language interaction system, where input images only play the role of providing additional context for chat; (2) the training and architecture details remain unclear, hindering research and open-source innovation in this field. 
            </p>

            <p>
              To demonstrate the new application scenarios of general-purpose assistants in the multimodal space, we introduce LLaVA-Interactive, an open-source demo system, backed by three powerful LV models and an easy-to-use, extensible framework. LLaVA-Interactive is favorable:

              <ol type="1">
                <li><b>Visual Interaction</b>. It supports visual prompt by allowing users to draw strokes and bounding boxes to better express human intents in visual creation process (including image segmentation and generation/editing), in addition to visual chat. Therefore, LLaVA-Interactive has demonstrated more engaged human-machine interaction experiences compared to GPT-4V/LLaVA, in terms of following human intents.
                </li>
                <li><b>Open-source</b>. We make our demo system and code base publicly available, to facilitate future improvement in the community</li>
              </ol>  

              This blog post provides a preliminary evaluation of LLaVA-Interactive's new capabilities and describes its work flow and serving infrastructure. We also invite the community to interact with our online demo to test the capabilities of this multimodal chatbot.

        This figure provides a workflow of LLaVA-Interactive. We describe the one typical visual creation process as below:

        <ol type="1">
            <li><b>Image Input</b>. <span style="font-size: 95%;"> To begin, an image is needed. The user can either upload an image, or generate an image by specifying its language caption and drawing bounding boxes for the intended spatial layout of the objects. Once the image is ready, one may play with image by applying one of following three steps: chat, segmentation or editing.</span></li>
            <li><b>Visual Chat</b>: <span style="font-size: 95%;"> Ask any questions about the image, eg, the suggestions on how to revise the image. Based on the editing suggestions, one may remove or add new objects using Step 3 or 4 respectively.</span></li>
            <li><b>Interactive Segmentation</b>: <span style="font-size: 95%;"> One may segment an object mask using either stroke drawing or text prompt. To remove it, please drag the mask out of the image, and a background will be aumatically filled. Alternatively, the masked can be dragged to a different location. To fill in a new object, please provide the text prompt for the mask</span></li>
            <li><b>Grounded Editing</b>: <span style="font-size: 95%;"> One may put new objects directly on the image, by drawing the bounding boxes and associating the corresponding concepts for the intended objects.</span></li>  
            <li><b>Mult-turn Interaction</b>: <span style="font-size: 95%;"> Repeating Step 2, 3 or 4 to iteratively refine the visual creation.</span></li>       
        </ol>  
        </p>

        <p>
          <h3 class="title is-4">Capability Comparisons</h3>
          Based on LLaVA that allows image input for visual chat only, LLaVA-Interactive extend it to support visual interaction such as user-drawn strokes and bounding box, as well as visual image generation/editing. Please see the comparisons of the capabilities below:

          <h3 class="title is-4">Behind the Scenes: Individual Models</h3>
          LLaVa-Interactive is an all-in-one demo that connects three LV models in one interactive session for image chat, segmentation and generation/editing, which can complete more complex tasks than a single model alone. As a background, we briefly describe the individual models for who are interested in the key techniques:  
          <ul type="1">
            <li><b><a href="https://llava-vl.github.io/">LLaVA</a></b>: <span style="font-size: 95%;">Large Language and Vision Assistant, the first open-source alternative to GPT-4V. It is an end-to-end trained large multimodal model that combines <a href="https://openai.com/research/clip">CLIP vision encoder</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat">Vicuna</a> for general-purpose visual understanding and reasoning, achieving impressive chat capabilities mimicking spirits of the GPT-4V.</span></li>
            <li><b><a href="https://github.com/UX-Decoder/Segment-Everything-Everywhere-All-At-Once">SEEM</a></b>: <span style="font-size: 95%;">Segment Everything Everywhere with Multi-modal prompts all at once. SEEM allows users to easily segment an image using prompts of different types including visual prompts (points, marks, boxes, scribbles) and language prompts. It can also work with any combination of prompts or generalize to custom prompts.</span></li>
            <li><b><a href="https://gligen.github.io/">GLIGEN</a></b>: <span style="font-size: 95%;">Grounded-Language-to-Image Generation, an open-source model that extends the functionality of existing pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models by enabling them to also be conditioned on visual prompts such as bounding boxes.</span></li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        <h3 class="title is-4">Development Challenges</h3>
        LLaVA-Interactive is a system-level demo synergy that leverages existing model checkpoints to build general-purpose assistants/agents, without any additional model training. Though the requirements on training AI models are low, it poses several technical challenges that we have addressed when developing LLaVA-Interactive along the way: 
        (1) One challenge we faced was that the GLIGEN inpainting model was not designed to handle filling the background hole. Instead, we used <a href="https://github.com/Sanster/lama-cleaner">LAMA</a> for background filling.
        (2) Another challenge was that <a href="https://www.gradio.app/">Gradio</a> did not have enough support for user interaction, such as drag-and-drop. We solved this by implementing a new Gradio Image component tool that enabled this functionality. 
        (3) The complexity of integrating several projects and models together, each of them being complex already. We overcame this by experimenting with different approaches and creating a very clean UI layout and an efficient data sharing scheme. 
        (4) The last challenge was managing different package requirements and dependencies. We dealt with this by running different models, such as LAMA, as separate web services.

First, pay attention to the weather conditions, as sudden changes in weather, especially strong winds or storms, can cause the water to become rough and pose risks to the stability of the pier. Second, be mindful of the structural integrity of the pier; avoid overloading it with too many people or excessive weight, as this could potentially damage the pier or cause it to collapse. Additionally, be aware of the surrounding wildlife and respect their space; do not harm or disturb them in any way. Finally, if you decide to go fishing, ensure that you adhere to any local fishing regulations and use appropriate fishing techniques to keep the lake ecosystem healthy and maintain the balance of the food chain.​​"],

            `Traveling to this picturesque location with a serene lake and mountains in the background was a refreshing and rejuvenating experience. The pier extending over the calm water provided an excellent vantage point from which to appreciate the breathtaking scenery. As I stood on the pier, I couldn't help but feel a deep connection with nature, taking a moment to soak in the peaceful atmosphere.​

One of the highlights of my trip was undoubtedly the fishing experience. The area is teeming with life, and I was thrilled to land a sizeable catch, despite the modest size of the lake. The joy of fishing in such a beautiful setting was truly rewarding, and it allowed me to take a break from my busy life and truly immerse myself in the tranquility of nature.​

While exploring the surrounding area, I came across a family of birds that had built a nest close to the pier, adding to the charm of the location. Interacting with the wildlife and observing their behavior was an enriching experience that I'll cherish for years to come.​

In conclusion, this idyllic destination provided me with an opportunity to unwind and recharge, surrounded by mesmerizing natural beauty and the gentle sounds of water and wildlife. If you're looking for a serene escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, this pier overlooking the lake is the perfect place to find solace and reconnect with nature.`
